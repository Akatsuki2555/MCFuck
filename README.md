# MCFuck

Old unfinished project where you can mess with your `options.txt` file.

## What does it do?

This program simply messes with your Minecraft settings.

It goes into your .minecraft folder, opens `options.txt` and changes a bunch of settings in there to random values.

It:

- Flips `true`/`false`
- Randomizes numbers
- Prevents destroying the settings file by not changing some values such as
  - Game version
